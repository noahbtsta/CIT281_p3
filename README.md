# Project 3

In this project I gained more practice breaking up a project into managable parts. I also got more 
insight about executing non-web server Node.js Javascript code. Learned about fastify and using
a GET route to return a certain value.

### Skills Used in Project
- Initialize folder as a git repo
- Created code module with the following functions 
-
   - validDenomination(coin)
   - valueFromCoinObject(obj)
   - valueFromArray(arr)
   - coinCount(...coinage)
  
 - Test the following code using console.log
 - Created two parameters for the specified coin: denom, count
 - Created html file that can be displayed in browser when navigating to the IP and port for the project web server
 -
